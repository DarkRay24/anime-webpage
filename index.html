                  The word anime — pronounced "ah-knee-may" — is an abbreviation of the word animation. In Japan, the word is used to refer to all animation. However, outside of Japan, it has become the catch-all term for animation from Japan. <br>
                  Most anime fans can sum this up in two words: "It's different." Anime is as unlike most American cartoons like "Batman" and "Spider-Man" are different from the comics that run in daily papers. Confused about where to start? We recommend "Death Note" and "Naruto" for starters. If you already know a friend who's an anime fan, clue them in on what you like to watch — they should be able to guide you best.

                  Manga is an umbrella term for a wide variety of comic books and graphic novels originally produced and published in Japan. Unlike American comic books, which are usually printed in full color, Japanese manga are almost always published in black and white. Full-color prints are often only used for special releases. 
                  <br><br>
                  The main difference between them and American comics is that manga make up a large percentage of the Japanese publishing market, so that there are comics available for all ages, genders and interests. Golf manga, football manga, fishing, superheroes, aliens, true crime, action...whatever a person might like, there is probably a manga about it.

                  Manga has a completely different distribution model than comics. Most manga is serialized in a publication - or, now, online - which allows for a longer, more complicated story to be told, with arcs for character development. Comics are sold as stand-alone items, with less and less page count per issue, to keep costs down, so less and less space for a story.
                  <br><br>
                  Manga is created and told by the same team from beginning to end. Comics are jobbed out to different creative teams as the publisher wants. So every 6 or 12 issues, to shake up the sales, they switch writers and artists, which means the previous year’s worth of story is retconned or rebooted to make way for a new one.

                  You have truly experienced Death Note only if you have read it in the Manga Comics. But to the non-comic book readers, there is not one but two above-average Live Action adaptations. Intelligent and handsome 17-year-old Light Yagami comes across a mysterious book called “Death Note,” which turns his life upside down.

                  The notebook is a magical killing machine; whoever’s name is mentioned in the book is killed. All the initial doubts are gone from Light’s head as one by one evil people or people who mess with the newly acclaimed “the God of the new world” aka Light, himself are murdered.

                    Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the second installation of this series, which sticks a lot to the original manga story and is longer than the previous one. This is one of the best shounen anime creations and targets the correct audience. This story has been said to be better than the first part, so it shouldn’t be confused with the first one.
                    <br>
                    The story of this part follows Fullmetal Alchemy but contains more emotions and teaches us a lot of life lessons. In addition, they have introduced a few more characters with strong development in every aspect, making this one of the greatest anime series.
                    The plot doesn’t have any loopholes, and nothing seems out of order here, making the story such a good ride. Brotherhood is a fictional piece of art and can also be enjoyed as a slice of life anime. Both the series is a must-watch.

                    Looking for some comedy-filled action? This is your man. This anime hero currently resides on Netflix and Hulu with two good seasons. Fans fell for the uniqueness of the idea of the story and the One Punch Hero. The story is quite simple but sounds definitely absurd, making it better; Saitama, a reluctant superhero, can knock anyone out with just one punch.

                    There is absolutely no one who can defeat this powerful, bald superhero, which obviously gets boring for him. So he starts finding a worthy opponent for himself for his own entertainment. The characters’ voiceovers could get a bit annoying, but the performance by the cast of the characters cover up for it.

                    Fortunately, the second season doesn’t lose the quirk and wit present in the first one, which makes One Punch Man a fun series with a different animation style, which was greatly appreciated by true anime fans.

                    Anyone who is not even an anime fan has heard the ever-so-great Naruto’s name, a shounen anime classic. Naruto has a series of video games, action figures, and 220 episodes in the series adaptation of the hit two, one-shot manga series by Kishimoto.

                    Many people grew up with this anime and continue to re-watch it on Netflix and call it a “legacy” to pass it on to fellow anime fans since it is one of the most incredible anime series ever. It has managed to garner such a loyal fan base that their best level starts and ends on “Naruto.”

                    This series can definitely be classified as a classic. For a lot, Naruto was the “first anime ever watched,” so it is highly sacred. This action anime is about a young boy, Naruto Uzumaki, a ninja with big aspirations and dreams; one of them is to be the “Hokage,” the leader of his village.

                    This adventure anime opened up paths for storylines containing ghosts and all the mystic creatures in one dimension. The action is well planned and different, making it a total package. Ichigo Kurosaki is a high school student and a reluctant soul reaper who goes on a mission to save Rukia Kuchiki, another soul reaper who failed in her task, which was to defeat a powerful ghost “hollows.”

                    Along with his friends who have magical powers and a calling for these spiritual energies, which would definitely help the battle between the students and soul reapers and ghosts, they go off on their mission.

                    There are 15 seasons, 366 episodes on Adult Swim, a go-to network for anime series, and Netflix. The plot is gripping, and once you start it, there’s no going back. After that, it’s just a lot of binge-watching, which you wouldn’t mind.
